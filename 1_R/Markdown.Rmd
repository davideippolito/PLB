## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### Write here to insert a subsection...

Here you can write free text to describe the code...

```{r}
#library(viridis)

x = 2 
y = 2
 x+y

```

## Hide code in the report 

You can also hide the code inside the HTML report adding `echo=FALSE`:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
x = 2 
y = 2
z = x+y
z
```

Other interesting options are described here: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html



## Use different programming languages

```{python}
print("Hello World!")
```



```{bash}
echo "Hello World!"
```


## Add web links in the report
